# Numpy_ANN
A simple, two layer ANN that learns how to classify images, using the ReLU activation function and gradient descent. The weights and biases are fine tuned through back propagation. You can expect to get anywhere from 80% to 90% accuracy for 100 iterations, or about 5 seconds. The data I used was the MNIST data set of handwritten numbers.
